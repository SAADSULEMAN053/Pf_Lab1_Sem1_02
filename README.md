# Pf_Lab1_Sem1_02
In this Project, I made a program that calculates **GPA/CGPA** of a student. This program is written in *C-LANGUAGE* and uses *if, if-else, nested if, for loops, while loops, nested loops, switch statements* along with *goto statements.*
## Things to improve
* Since this program only calculates gpa with only four Credit Hours for each subject studied in the semester. So it needs to have an input where it scans credit hours for each subject aswell.
* Needs a grade with the final cgpa result currently it only shows cgpa in decimals ( I don't know if I need to mention this but it does show grades but only with subjects not gpa/cgpa).
